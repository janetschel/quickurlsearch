# quickurlsearch Chrome extension
Search a custom website quickly with built in shortcuts

## Features
### Version 0.0.1

**Experimental version!**
In this version you can quickly lookup [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) by typing `!mdn` in your address bar followed by the searchterm

For exmaple `!mdn substring` will forward you to the MDN site an search for `substring`, thus saving you valuable time

Only works when google is set as the default search engine
